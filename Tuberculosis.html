                    <p class="Tuberculosis_text1">Overview</p>
                    <p class="Tuberculosis_text2">Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that most often affects the lungs and is caused by a type of bacteria. It spreads through the air when infected people cough, sneeze or spit.
                        <br>
                        Tuberculosis is preventable and curable.
                        <br>
                        About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria. About 5–10% of people infected with TB will eventually get symptoms and develop TB disease.
                        <br>
                        Those who are infected but not (yet) ill with the disease cannot transmit it. TB disease is usually treated with antibiotics and can be fatal without treatment.
                        <br>
                        In certain countries, the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given to babies or small children to prevent TB. The vaccine prevents TB outside of the lungs but not in the lungs.</p>
                        <p class="Tuberculosis_text1">Treatment</p>
                        <p class="Tuberculosis_text2">Tuberculosis disease is treated with antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease.
                            <br>
                            The most common antibiotics used are:
                            
                           
                       i) isoniazid
                       <br>
                        ii) rifampin
                        <br>
                        iii) pyrazinamide
                        <br>
                        iv) ethambutol
                        <br>
                        v)streptomycin.
                             </p>
                                <p class="Tuberculosis_text2">To be effective, these medications need to be taken daily for 4–6 months. It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice. This can allow TB that is still alive to become resistant to the drugs.
                            <br><br>
                            Tuberculosis that doesn’t respond to standard drugs is called drug-resistant TB and requires more toxic treatment with different medicines.</p>
                                </p>
                                <p class="Tuberculosis_text1">Multidrug-resistant TB</p>
                                <p class="Tuberculosis_text2">Drug resistance emerges when TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, or patients stopping treatment prematurely.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs. However, second-line treatment options require extensive medicines that are expensive and toxic.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In some cases, more extensive drug resistance can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line TB drugs can leave patients with very limited treatment options.
                                    <br><br>
                                    MDR-TB remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. Only about 2 in 5 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2022.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In accordance with WHO guidelines, detection of MDR/RR-TB requires bacteriological confirmation of TB and testing for drug resistance using rapid molecular tests or culture methods.
                                    <br>
                                    In 2022, new WHO guidelines prioritize a 6-month regimen – the BPaLM/BPaL – as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need. In the past, MDR-TB treatment used to last for at least 9 months and up to 20 months. WHO recommends expanded access to all-oral regimens. TB</p>
                                    <p class="Tuberculosis_text1">Impact</p>
                                    <p class="Tuberculosis_text2">Tuberculosis mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries.
                                        <br><br>
                                        TB occurs in every part of the world. In 2022, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in WHO’s South-East Asian Region (46%), followed by the African Region (23%) and the Western Pacific (18%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with more than two-thirds of the global total in Bangladesh, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Globally, about 50% of TB patients and their households face total costs (direct medical expenditures, non-medical expenditures and indirect costs such as income losses) that are catastrophic (>20% of total household income), far from the WHO End TB Strategy target of zero. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, undernutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill. Globally in 2022, there were 2.2 million new TB cases that were attributable to undernutrition, 0.89 million to HIV infection, 0.73 million to alcohol use disorders, 0.70 million to smoking and 0.37 million to diabetes.</p>
                                    <p class="Tuberculosis_text1">Investments to end TB</p>
                                    <p class="Tuberculosis_text2">US$ 13 billion are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets agreed on at the UN high level-TB meeting. 
                                        <br><br>

                                        As in the past decade, most of the spending on TB services in 2022 (80%) was from domestic sources. In low- and middle-income countries, international donor funding remains crucial. The main source is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund). The United States Government is the largest contributor of funding to the Global Fund and also the largest bilateral donor. For research and development, according to the Treatment Action Group, only US$ 1 billion were available in 2022 of the US$ 2 billion required per year to accelerate the development of new tools. At least an extra US$ 1 billion per year is needed to accelerate the development of new tools. </p>

                                        <p class="Tuberculosis_text2">WHO is working closely with countries, partners and civil society in scaling up the TB response.
